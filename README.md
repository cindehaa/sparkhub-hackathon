## Introduction
Upon reflecting on the theme of "entrepreneurship", we decided to interview local businesses to get to understand the everyday challenges that they are facing. One story that stood out to us was a farmer that our Full Stack developer Han interviewed, where he brought us aware of the massive amount of food waste that is generated by farmers markets across the country. Because farmers are unable to sell their excess produce at the end of the day, substantial amounts of profit is lost, along with boxes upon boxes of food that must be thrown out.

We sought out to fix this problem by creating HarvestHub--a convenient website that connects consumers to nearby farmers markets. Farmers can create listings of items that would otherwise been tossed away, and consumers like local restaurents, can purchase these items at a discounted price and have the food delivered straight to their doorsteps. We envision a world where farmers and restaurants alike can create a profile and post and purchase food items with ease.

Our Hackathon team values supporting local businesses and environmental sustainability. Using our website, we support farmers in making additional profit, local businesses with purchasing cheaper food items, other consumers who would enjoy the convenience of ordering farmers market produce online, and the environment by reducing unnecessary waste.

We've outlined our specific website features, technologies used, and future roadmap down below, along with the steps for you to view our website yourselves.
